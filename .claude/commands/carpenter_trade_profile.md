## VAT Treatment of Supplies

A carpenter/joiner typically makes **mixed supplies** of goods (materials) and services (labour). The VAT treatment depends on what is being supplied:

| Supply Type | VAT Rate | Examples |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Construction services (labour) | 13.5% | Fitting a kitchen, hanging doors, building a deck, renovation work |
| Repair of moveable goods (labour) | 13.5% | Repairing furniture, fixing a window frame |
| Supply of goods (materials sold separately) | 23% | Selling timber, selling a custom-built cabinet as a standalone product |
| Supply and fit (two-thirds rule applies) | See below | Supply and install kitchen cabinets, supply and fit doors |

---

## Two-Thirds Rule (Critical for Carpenters)

When a carpenter supplies AND fits materials, the two-thirds rule determines the VAT rate:

1. Calculate the **VAT-exclusive cost of materials** to the carpenter (not the price charged to customer)
2. Calculate the **total charge to the customer** (excl VAT) — includes materials, labour, and any markup on materials
3. If materials cost < 2/3 of total charge → **13.5%** on entire supply (deemed a service)
4. If materials cost ≥ 2/3 of total charge → **23%** on entire supply (deemed goods)

**Example — Kitchen fitting:**
- Cost of kitchen units to carpenter: €3,000 (excl VAT)
- Total charge to customer: €5,500 (excl VAT) — includes labour, markup, fitting
- Materials as % of total: €3,000 / €5,500 = 54.5% → **less than 2/3 → 13.5% applies to entire €5,500**
- VAT = €5,500 × 13.5% = €742.50
- Invoice total = €6,242.50

**Example — Supply and fit premium hardwood flooring:**
- Cost of flooring to carpenter: €4,200 (excl VAT)
- Total charge to customer: €5,800 (excl VAT)
- Materials as % of total: €4,200 / €5,800 = 72.4% → **more than 2/3 → 23% applies to entire €5,800**
- VAT = €5,800 × 23% = €1,334
- Invoice total = €7,134
- **Alternative**: Carpenter can itemise labour separately on invoice → 23% on materials portion, 13.5% on labour portion (saves the customer money)

## RCT Obligations (Construction Subcontractor)

If the carpenter works as a **subcontractor** for a principal contractor:
- Must register for VAT (normal rules)
- Does **NOT charge VAT** on construction services supplied to the principal contractor
- The principal contractor applies a **reverse charge** — accounts for VAT as if they supplied the service
- The subcontractor's invoice shows the net amount without VAT
- The principal contractor includes the amount in both T1 (outputs) and T2 (inputs) on their VAT return
- **Exception**: Haulage for hire — VAT must still be charged

If the carpenter IS the **principal contractor** (hiring subcontractors):
- Must operate RCT on payments to subcontractors
- Must apply the reverse charge on subcontractor invoices in the VAT return
- Deduct RCT at the appropriate rate (0%, 20%, or 35%) from payments to subcontractors

---

## VAT Registration Considerations

A carpenter supplying both goods and services:
- If **goods ≥ 90% of turnover** → €85,000 threshold applies
- If **services > 10% of turnover** → €42,500 threshold applies (lower threshold)
- Most carpenters supply a mix → the **€42,500 threshold** typically applies

**Should a carpenter below threshold voluntarily register?**
- **Yes, if** most customers are VAT-registered businesses (they can reclaim VAT, and the carpenter can claim input credits on materials, tools, diesel, etc.)
- **No, if** most customers are private homeowners (they cannot reclaim VAT, so it increases the carpenter's prices by 13.5-23%)

---

## Cash Receipts Basis (Common for Carpenters)

Many carpenters qualify for the cash receipts basis because:
- They often supply mainly to private homeowners (unregistered persons >90% of supplies), OR
- Total taxable supplies are under €2 million

**Benefit**: VAT is only due to Revenue when the customer actually pays, not when the invoice is issued. This avoids the cash-flow problem of paying VAT on unpaid invoices.
